This tutorial shows you how to build and deploy your own neural search service to look through descriptions of companies from startups-list.com and pick the most similar ones to your query. The website contains the company names, descriptions, locations, and a picture for each entry.

A neural search service uses artificial neural networks to improve the accuracy and relevance of search results. Besides offering simple keyword results, this system can retrieve results by meaning. It can understand and interpret complex search queries and provide more contextually relevant output, effectively enhancing the userâ€™s search experience.
There is a version of this tutorial that uses Fastembed model inference engine instead of Sentence Transformers. Check it out here.
Workflow

To create a neural search service, you will need to transform your raw data and then create a search function to manipulate it. First, you will 1) download and prepare a sample dataset using a modified version of the BERT ML model. Then, you will 2) load the data into Qdrant, 3) create a neural search API and 4) serve it using FastAPI.
